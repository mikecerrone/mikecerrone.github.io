<p> I am stoked to be embarking on the DBC Journey. I was already excited to jump in to the work but the idea that the curriculum is centered around getting the most out of your time is fantastic. I was really pleasantly surprised by the mindfulness practice we got in week one and found myself reflecting on things outside of the class work. I also thought it was spot on that the video pointed out some of the prejudgements we all create when starting something new. Now that it has been pointed out to me it makes it much easier to not be owned by those feelings. I am looking forward to making a positive impact in any way I can. </p>
