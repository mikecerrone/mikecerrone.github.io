<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
    It was great. My wireframe was a bit to advanced for the excersise and my partners was just right.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
     I did. I found it critical to have an idea of what you are building before starting to code.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
     For this challange we decided that a wireframe that we could create with our current skills in the timebox.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
     I learned a bit more about "div" They can be used for many different things. We used them to divide the secions of our blog.
