What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I leared that when you are able to inspect element in the borwser and see where each of the elements are. This was extreemly helpful when trying to get everything formatted. The fact that they are each color coded makes it really easy to understand what needs to be done.



What did you learn about CSS positioning?
There are a number of different ways to do the same thing. The more complicated your site becomes the harder each change would be to fix. Other keys would be to check where other elements are on the page before trying to drop in a new element.


What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
I found it easiest to create classes and format text and imiges with them. It was straitforard and powerful. Definately, positioning was the most difficult, specifically getting things exactly where you want them. It is super tedious and sometimes you go backwards breaking major things trying to more somethig a few pixels.


What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned to understand the size of images before adding them and to resize them in CSS as soon as possible.
